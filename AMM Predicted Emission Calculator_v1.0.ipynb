    "## AMM Predicted Emission Calculator v1.0, 7/24/20\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This program estimates future US AMM emissions from mines closed in a given set of years. The methodology is adapted from Kholod et al., 2020 (full citation in RefWorks), and uses gross coal production rather than individual mine data. To use, click the button that says \"Run\" above (it might take more than one click to start) and follow the prompts. I imagine there are still a few bugs I haven't caught, so if you get some sort of error message just run it again!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methodology\n",
    "The model has a few underlying assumptions. First, it expects active coal mine methane emissions to equal approximately the product of total coal mined nationally (tonnes) and the average gas content of that coal (m^3/tonne; also known as the emission factor). This is the same approach taken by the EPA and the IPCC in forecasting CMM emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it assumes that some fraction of coal produced annually is abandoned, and therefore should be moved into the AMM-producing category. This fraction is the \"coal abandonment rate.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Once coal becomes abandoned, its emissions are governed by industry-standard decline curves. Because flooded and dry mines emit at different rates, we need here another initial parameter, the \"flooding rate\" (the fraction of abandoned coal that floods annually).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Kholod et al. use a 5% coal abandonment rate and a 50% flooding rate globally; I think these may be a bit high, but I've kept them as defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because abandoned mine methane is only recoverable from underground mines, I've included the percentage of coal mined underground (35%) as a fixed coefficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together, then,\n",
    "AMM emissions for a given year  = (total coal production that year) x (emission factor) x (abandonment rate) x (percent underground) + (emissions from dry mines closed in prior years) + (emissions from flooded mines closed in prior years,\n",
    "where (emissions from dry mines closed in prior years) and (emissions from flooded mines closed in prior years) are just sums of the various decline curves. \n",
    "\n",
    "One important note: *this method only calculates emissions from mines closed in a future range of years that you choose.* It does not include methane from already abandoned mines, and although it forecasts out to 2050, it will only \"close\" mines for the number of years you tell it to (this may make more sense if you try it).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "**Fixed:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial decline rate for dry mines = 0.302 (Source: Kholod et. al)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperbolic rate of change for dry decline rate = 2.017 (Source: Kholod et. al)\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial decline rate for flooded mines = 0.672 (Source: Kholod et. al)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fraction of coal mined underground = 0.35 (Source: EIA)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjustable:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Coal mine closure time range: Number of years for which you want to take into account coal production. For example, if you input '2' you will get back estimations for how coal mines closed in 2020 and 2021 will emit out to 2050. If you input '31' you will get back estimations for how all future mine closures will emit out to 2050.\n",
    "\n",
    "Coal production forecast: Prediction of number of tonnes coal that will be mined in the US annually, from now until 2050. Right now the only option is 'EIA', but I'm looking to add more scenarios soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abandonment rate: The percentage of coal \"that would have been produced but is not produced because of mine closure\" (Kholod et al., 2020). The default is '5'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emission factors: Roughly, the proportionality constants betweeen coal mined at a certain depth/rank and gas produced. Options are 'IPCC' (the standard factors used in the IPCC's 2006 GHG inventory methodology) and 'M2CM' (the proprietary factors developed by Kholod et al.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Flood rate: Percentage of coal that floods annually. Default is '50'.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps\n",
    "— Debug\n",
    "\n",
    "— Quantify/include uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "— Obtain more precise range of values for abandonment rate\n",
    "\n",
    "— Add basin-specific granularity wherever possible"
